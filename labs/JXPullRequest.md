# Doing a pull request

Once we checked that our first 0.0.1 version is deployed into Staging, let’s change our application in a different git branch and create a pull request to merge into master.

## Creating the GitHub Pull Request

Let’s get into the local git repo:

```bash
cd ~/jx-gke-lab/jx-go-http
```

Then, create a new branch for the pull request and check it out from your Cloud Shell:

```bash
git checkout -b my-pr
```

Open the Cloud Shell editor and update the main.go file:

```bash
cloudshell edit main.go
```

The Cloud Shell editor should open the file, that you can now edit graphically.  Update line 10 so it the variable title has a new value. The new line should like like this:

        title := "Jenkins X golang http example by <your name>"

When done, press Ctrl + S (or Command + S if you're using a Mac).
Now, stage the change for commit and commit the change to GitHub:

```bash
git add main.go
git commit -m "New welcome message"
```

Finally, push the changes to GitHub:

```bash
git push --set-upstream origin my-pr
```

Now we are ready to create the Pull Request (PR). So, let’s use the GitHub web console to create the pull request with the changes you pushed from your “my-pr” branch:
* Go to https://github.com/<your_github_username>/jx-go-http
* Check that your changes are waiting for creating the PR and select “Compare & pull request” (DON’T FORGET TO SIGN IN INTO GITHUB!)
* Then edit your PR message (e.g. “New welcome message”)
* Check your changes 

Here you have some screenshots to see the process:

> **Note:** Instead of using GitHub web console you can also create the pull request directly from Jenkins X with the following command
> 
> `$> jx create pr -t “New welcome message” `
> 
> Open then the link that is the output of the command and you go directly to the pull request created.

## Preview the application and approve the Pull Request

Once the Pull Request is created on GitHub we sould use the Prow commands to approve the pull request via ChatOps, so then the merge and pipelines are triggered automatically once one of the approvers in the “OWNERS” file of the application repo select `/approve` or `/lgtm` (Looks Good to Me). 

The following actions happened automatically when we created the PR:
* An approval notifier is saying that “This PR is NOT APPROVED” and suggest some ChatOps commands that can be used from Prow
  
![Approval Notifier in GitHub](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dcanadillas/jenkins-x-lab/master/images/GHPRApprovalNotifier.png)
  
* Then, a size label is attached to the change proposed in the PR (size/XS) in this case

* After a minute more or less a Preview environment is created and deployed

Check the progress of the PR build:

```bash
jx get activity -f dcanadillas/jx-go-http/PR-1
```

You can check the preview environment by:

```bash
jx get previews
```

```

```

So, you can check the application preview environment by going to the previous URL in the output of ‘jx get previews’. There you should see your changes in Development to be merged into Master and then to be able to deploy a new version into Staging:

In this lab we didn’t configure a different GitHub user to act as “a bot” so you cannot approve your own PR with the `/approve` command of Prow. So, in this case we will close the PR manually to trigger the promotion pipeline into Staging:

![Merging manually the PR](images/GHMergePR.png)

> **Note:**
> 
> During the installation process you could have configured a different GitHub user for the “Pipeline Server”. This user then act as a “bot” to generate the comments automatically in the Pull Request to work with Prow.
> 
> Then, you could approve a pull request just by commenting “/approve” in the PR messages if you are one of the approvers defined in the repo `OWNERS` file.
> ![Approve Prow command in GitHub](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dcanadillas/jenkins-x-lab/master/images/ApproveProw.png)

This should trigger the promotion pipeline into Staging. Let’s check the execution:

```bash
jx get activity -f jx-go-http -w
```

Once we check in the previous output that the Pull Request #2 is succeeded, we can see our new version deployed:

```bash
jx get version
```

Output (do not copy)

```
APPLICATION STAGING PODS URL
jx-go-http  0.0.2   1/1  http://jx-go-http.jx-staging.35.189.194.245.nip.io
```

Let’s check the application deployed into staging by:

```bash
jx open jx-go-http -e staging
```

If we open the output url shown from the previous output in a browser tab the new version 0.0.2 of the application with the changes is shown.
